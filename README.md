# agents-radar

English | [中文](./README.zh.md)

A GitHub Actions workflow that runs every morning at 07:00 CST. It aggregates AI ecosystem signals from 10 data sources, then publishes bilingual (Chinese + English) daily digests as GitHub Issues and committed Markdown files.

## RSS Feed

**[https://duanyytop.github.io/agents-radar/feed.xml](https://duanyytop.github.io/agents-radar/feed.xml)**

Subscribe in any RSS reader (Feedly, Reeder, NewsBlur, etc.) to receive new digests automatically. The feed includes the latest 30 reports across all report types, updated daily alongside `manifest.json`.

## MCP Server

**`https://agents-radar-mcp.duanyytop.workers.dev`**

A hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes agents-radar data as tools. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, etc.) can query the latest AI ecosystem reports directly.

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_reports` | List available dates and report types (last N days) |
| `get_latest` | Fetch the most recent report of a given type |
| `get_report` | Fetch a specific report by date and type |
| `search` | Keyword search across recent reports |

**Claude Desktop setup** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agents-radar": {
      "url": "https://agents-radar-mcp.duanyytop.workers.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. You can then ask Claude things like:
- *"What's the latest in AI CLI tools?"* → calls `get_latest`
- *"Search for Claude Code mentions this week"* → calls `search`
- *"Show me the AI trending report for 2026-03-05"* → calls `get_report`

**OpenClaw setup** — run the following command:

```bash
openclaw mcp add --transport http agents-radar https://agents-radar-mcp.duanyytop.workers.dev
```

Or add it manually to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agents-radar": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://agents-radar-mcp.duanyytop.workers.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

You can then ask OpenClaw things like:
- *"What's the latest in AI CLI tools?"* → calls `get_latest`
- *"Search for Claude Code mentions this week"* → calls `search`
- *"Show me the AI trending report for 2026-03-05"* → calls `get_report`

**Self-hosting** — deploy your own instance from the `mcp/` directory:

```bash
cd mcp
pnpm install
wrangler deploy
```

## Tracked sources

pulled in.

### Claude Code Skills (GitHub)

| Source | Repository |
|--------|-----------|
| Claude Code Skills | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) |

PRs and issues are fetched without a date filter and sorted by popularity (comment count), so the report always reflects the most actively discussed skills — not just the newest.

### OpenClaw + AI agent ecosystem (GitHub)

OpenClaw is tracked as the primary reference project, alongside several peer projects in the personal AI assistant / autonomous agent space for cross-ecosystem comparison.

| Project | Repository | Stars |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| OpenClaw | [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | 387.8k |
| Hermes Agent | [nousresearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) | 237.0k |
| QwenPaw | [agentscope-ai/QwenPaw](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw) | 34.5k |

| IronClaw | [nearai/ironclaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | 12.6k |

### AI infrastructure (GitHub)

The inference and serving layer the agent/CLI tools run on top of — tracked in a dedicated report with its own cross-project comparison.

| Project | Repository | Layer | Stars |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Ollama | [ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) | Local runtime | 177.2k |
| llama.cpp | [ggml-org/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) | Inference engine | 121.9k |
| vLLM | [vllm-project/vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | Serving engine | 87.5k |

| LiteLLM | [BerriAI/litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | LLM gateway | 55.0k |
| SGLang | [sgl-project/sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) | Serving engine | 30.9k |

Summaries focus on new model/hardware support, performance work, breaking changes, and what each change means for developers building on top of these projects.

### GitHub AI Trending

Two data sources are fetched in parallel every day:

| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| [github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending?since=daily) | Today's trending repos — parsed from HTML; includes today's new star count |
| GitHub Search API | Repos active in the last 7 days matching 6 AI topics: `llm`, `ai-agent`, `rag`, `vector-database`, `large-language-model`, `machine-learning` |

The LLM filters out non-AI repos from the trending list, classifies the rest by dimension (AI infrastructure / agents / applications / models / RAG), and extracts trend signals.

### Hacker News

Top AI stories from the last 24 hours, fetched via the [Algolia HN Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api). Six queries run in parallel (`AI`, `LLM`, `Claude`, `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `machine learning`), results are deduplicated and ranked by points. The top 30 stories are passed to the LLM for analysis.

### Official web content (sitemap-based)

| Organization | Site | Tracked sections |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com) | `/news/`, `/research/`, `/engineering/`, `/learn/` |
| OpenAI | [openai.com](https://openai.com) | research, publication, release, company, engineering, milestone, learn-guides, safety, product |

New articles are detected by comparing sitemap `lastmod` timestamps against a persisted state file (`digests/web-state.json`). On the **first run**, up to 25 recent articles per site are fetched and a comprehensive overview report is generated. On subsequent runs, only new or updated URLs trigger a report; if nothing changed, the web report step is skipped entirely.

## Features

- Fetches issues, pull requests, and releases updated in the last 24 hours across all tracked repos
- Tracks trending Claude Code Skills — sorted by community engagement, not recency
- Generates a per-tool summary for each CLI repository and a cross-tool comparative analysis
- Generates a deep OpenClaw project report plus a cross-ecosystem comparison against 4 peer projects
- Tracks 6 AI infrastructure projects (inference engines, gateways, fine-tuning) with a dedicated report and cross-project comparison
- Scrapes official Anthropic and OpenAI web content via sitemaps; detects new articles incrementally
- Monitors GitHub Trending daily + searches 6 AI topic tags; classifies repos by dimension and extracts trend signals
- Fetches top-30 AI stories from Hacker News (last 24h, ranked by points); generates community sentiment report
- Publishes GitHub Issues for each report type; commits Markdown files to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Generates every report body once in English and translates it to Chinese, instead of running the whole pipeline twice per language
- Runs on a daily schedule via GitHub Actions; supports manual triggering
- All tracked repositories are configurable via `config.yml` — no code changes needed

## Setup

### 1. Fork this repository

### 2. Customize `config.yml` (optional)

Edit `config.yml` in the repo root to add, remove, or replace the tracked repositories. The file is fully commented. No code changes are needed — the pipeline reads it on every run and falls back to built-in defaults if the file is absent.

```yaml
# Add a new CLI tool
cli_repos:
  - id: my-tool
    repo: owner/my-ai-cli
    name: My AI Tool

# Add a new peer project to the OpenClaw ecosystem comparison
openclaw_peers:
  - id: my-agent
    repo: owner/my-agent
    name: My Agent

# Add a new AI infrastructure project
infra_repos:
  - id: my-engine
    repo: owner/my-engine
    name: My Engine
    paginated: true   # for repos with >100 daily issue/PR updates
```

### 3. Add Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | optional | `anthropic` (default), `openai`, `github-copilot`, `openrouter`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, `glm`, or `minimax` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | if Anthropic | API key — works with both Anthropic and Kimi Code |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | optional | API endpoint override. Set to `https://api.kimi.com/coding/` for Kimi Code; leave unset for Anthropic |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | if OpenAI | OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | optional | OpenAI endpoint override |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | if OpenRouter | OpenRouter API key |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | if DeepSeek | DeepSeek API key |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | if Qwen | Alibaba Model Studio API key |
| `GLM_API_KEY` | if GLM | Zhipu BigModel API key |
| `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | if MiniMax | MiniMax API key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | optional | Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). If set, a message is sent after each digest run |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | optional | Telegram chat/channel/group ID to send notifications to |
| `FEISHU_WEBHOOK_URLS` | optional | Comma-separated Feishu custom bot webhook URLs. If set, a card message is sent to each group after each digest run |
| `FEISHU_SECRET` | optional | Feishu custom bot signature secret — required when the bot has signature verification (签名校验) enabled |

> `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions. When using `github-copilot` as the provider, the same `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used for LLM calls.

**Setting up Telegram notifications** (optional):
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, create a bot, and copy the token
2. Add the bot to your channel/group, or start a DM with it
3. Get the chat ID via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or the [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) API
4. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` as repository secrets

> If neither secret is set, the notification step is silently skipped.

### 3. Enable the workflow

Confirm the workflow is enabled in the **Actions** tab.

To test immediately, go to **Actions → Daily Agents Radar → Run workflow**.

> **First run note**: The web content step will fetch up to 50 articles (25 per site) and may take a few extra minutes. Subsequent runs are fast — only new articles are processed.

## LLM providers

Set `LLM_PROVIDER` to choose which model backend powers the digest generation. Defaults to `anthropic`.

| Provider | `LLM_PROVIDER` | Required env vars | Default model |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4o` |
| GitHub Copilot | `github-copilot` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `gpt-4o` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Qwen | `qwen` | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | `qwen-flash` |
| GLM (Zhipu) | `glm` | `GLM_API_KEY` | `glm-5.3` |
| MiniMax | `minimax` | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | `MiniMax-M3` |

Override the model name with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `GITHUB_COPILOT_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`, `QWEN_MODEL`, `GLM_MODEL`, or `MINIMAX_MODEL` respectively. The Qwen endpoint can be overridden with `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`, the GLM endpoint with `GLM_BASE_URL`, the MiniMax endpoint with `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`.

Set `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` to a second provider name to hedge against rate limits and outages: when the primary provider has exhausted its retry ladder on a call, the fallback provider is tried once for that call. A call rescued by the fallback is not counted as a failure in the run's LLM health stats.

Set `LLM_DEEP_PROVIDER` to route a small number of high-value analysis calls to a reasoning-grade model (`callLlm(prompt, maxTokens, "deep")`): the three cross-repo comparisons, the trending report, and the web report — about 5 calls per run. Everything else (per-repo summaries, listing reports, translations, highlights — 50+ calls) stays on the default tier. This split exists because reasoning models like glm-5.3 rate-limit under bulk load; a deep-tier call that exhausts its retries falls to the default-tier provider, then to `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER`. When `LLM_DEEP_PROVIDER` is unset, deep-tier calls simply use the primary provider.

The scheduled daily run uses `minimax` / `MiniMax-M3` as the default tier, `glm` / `glm-5.3` as the deep tier (`LLM_DEEP_PROVIDER=glm`) and as fallback (`LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=glm`).

The provider abstraction lives in `src/providers/` — each provider is a separate file implementing the `LlmProvider` interface. Adding a new provider only requires creating a new file and registering it in the factory.

Historical digests are stored in [`digests/`](./digests/). Published issues are tagged by type: [`digest`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adigest) · [`openclaw`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aopenclaw) · [`web`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aweb) · [`trending`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atrending) · [`hn`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ahn) · [`ph`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aph) · [`arxiv`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aarxiv) · [`hf`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ahf) · [`community`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acommunity).

Only the most recent day's issues are left open — `pnpm close-stale` closes everything older on each run, so the issue list stays at roughly one day's worth instead of thousands. Nothing is deleted: the label links above include closed issues, and the full archive also lives under `digests/` and in the Web UI. Issues without a digest label, and pull requests, are never touched.

Weekly and monthly rollup reports were discontinued in July 2026; past ones remain browsable under `digests/` and in the Web UI.

## Schedule

| Workflow | Cron | UTC | CST |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| Daily digest (am) | `37 23 * * *` | 23:37 daily | 07:37 next day |
| Daily digest (pm, evening update) | `37 11 * * *` | 11:37 daily | 19:37 |

The **pm run** is an evening update: it rewrites the day's markdown in place, never opens issues (`SKIP_ISSUES=true`), and skips the commit plus notifications when a normalized diff (timestamp lines and `highlights.json` excluded) shows no substantive change from the am run.

To change the schedule, edit the cron expression in `.github/workflows/daily-digest.yml`.

GitHub's scheduled runs are queued, not guaranteed — typical delay for this workflow is 10-15 minutes, so a 06:37 CST start lands the digest around 07:00 CST. The minute is off the hour on purpose: the `:00` slot is the most contended, and while this workflow sat at `0 23 * * *` the delays degraded from minutes to hours (the 2026-08-26 run was dispatched 5h07m late, and the 2026-08-27 run was never created at all).

When a scheduled run is late enough that you dispatch a catch-up run manually, the two would otherwise both build the same day's digest and open a duplicate set of issues. Two guards prevent that: a `concurrency: daily-digest` group serializes overlapping runs, and a `guard` job skips any **scheduled** run whose `digests/YYYY-MM-DD` folder (CST date) is already committed. Manual `workflow_dispatch` runs always proceed, so you can still force a regeneration.
