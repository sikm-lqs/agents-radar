## OpenClaw Deep Dive

# OpenClaw Project Digest — 2026-09-15

## 1. Today's Overview

OpenClaw exhibits an exceptionally high activity cadence in the 24 hours preceding this digest: **500 issues** and **500 pull requests** updated, with **191 issues closed** and **212 PRs merged/closed**. The activity is dominated by firefighting around the recent **2026.9.x release line**, particularly gateway stability, update/recovery reliability, and session-state regressions. No new releases were cut in the last 24 hours, suggesting the team is currently prioritizing triaging and merging fixes rather than shipping new versions — a pattern consistent with active stabilization after a problematic minor release. The mix of P0 release-blockers, crash-loops, and several "diamond lobster" / "platinum hermit" priority labels indicates a project under meaningful pressure, but with a strong inflow of community-discovered issues and credible PRs.

## 2. Releases

*No new releases in the last 24 hours.* The most recent tagged versions referenced in issues are **2026.9.2, 2026.9.3, and 2026.9.4**, each carrying their own set of follow-up regressions (see Bugs & Stability below).

## 3. Project Progress

A substantial batch of PRs landed or closed today, focused on stability, hot-reload correctness, plugin loader hygiene, and channel-adapter consistency:

- **[#148310](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148310)** — fix: command secret gate skips env SecretRefs on quoted config keys (closes [#148131](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/148131)). Auth-fix; prevents a `0`-named account from reaching 401 due to misresolved env credentials.
- **[#148608](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148608)** — fix(worktrees): prevent cleanup failures on large ignored trees (closes [#148599](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/148599)). Worktree hygiene.
- **[#148606](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148606)** — fix(memory): drain agent state before watcher fixture cleanup (maintainer follow-up).
- **[#148581](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148581)** — fix(openai): `gpt-5.4-nano` rejected as incompatible when codex plugin enabled (closes [#148559](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/148559)).
- **[#148463](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148463)** — improve(plugins): skip unnecessary startup path checks (performance, no behavior change).
- **[#148499](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148499)** — fix: stabilize config include revision tests (test-only fix, closed).
- **[#148592](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148592)** — fix(gateway): keep hot reload alive when cron reconciliation is still converging.
- **[#146913](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/146913)** — fix(gateway): isolate deferred config reload context (supersedes [#146368](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/146368)).
- **[#148607](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148607)** — fix: session updates fail when participant cache refresh throws.
- **[#148278](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148278)** — perf(memory): avoid durable leases during captured session preparation (closed).
- **[#148577](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148577)** — perf(android): reduce outbox database reads (closed).
- **[#147971](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/147971)** — perf: compile measured nested tool validation.
- **[#147936](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/147936)** — chore(ui): refresh control ui locales.
- **[#148604](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148604)** — fix(update): finish 2026.9.3 managed upgrades after migration (fixes [#148454](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/148454)).

Of the 30 top PRs by activity, **~10 were closed/merged** today, with the remainder queued for maintainer review. Several closed PRs (e.g., [#148499](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148499), [#148577](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148577)) were low-risk housekeeping fixes, indicating healthy merge hygiene.

## 4. Community Hot Topics

The most-discussed items in the last 24h cluster around **session state integrity** and **text-routing correctness**:

1. **[#25592 — Text between tool calls leaks to messaging channels](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/25592)** (40 comments, 🦞 diamond lobster). The longest-standing top issue: internal narration/error text gets routed to Slack/iMessage as visible messages. A real UX/safety concern with high community engagement.
2. **[#97616 — Unreaped hook/tool child processes leak as zombies](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/97616)** (31 comments, 🦐 gold shrimp). Long-running degradation bug affecting multiple deployment shapes.
3. **[#88312 — 2026.5.27 Codex app-server turn-completion stall (regression)](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/88312)** (22 comments, closed, 🐚 platinum hermit, 👍5). Regression-of-regression tracking; previously fixed by [#85107](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/85107).
4. **[#119720 — Synchronous agent persistence blocks the Gateway event loop at scale](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/119720)** (20 comments,  diamond lobster). High-priority performance bug; partial repairs have already landed in [#140231](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/140231) and [#138984](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/138984).
5. **[#48788 — Centralized filename encoding utility for multi-encoding Content-Disposition](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/48788)** (20 comments). Architectural request stemming from [#48578](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/48578); community wants a proper encoding abstraction for Feishu/JP/KR filenames.
6. **[#102175 — Embedded prompt cache breaks across boundaries](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/102175)** (19 comments,  platinum hermit). Long-lived sessions silently lose prompt-cache reuse; subtle cost / correctness issue.
7. **[#144911 — MCP server init timeout crashes the Gateway](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/144911)** (16 comments, 🦞 diamond lobster). Recent crash bug; an unhandled rejection in child cleanup takes down the whole process.

**Underlying community needs:** session integrity under failure, predictable channel routing, encoding-correctness for non-ASCII regions, and avoidance of single-stuck-process-escalates-to-full-crash scenarios. Issues repeatedly cite the same architectural pattern — async cleanup paths that throw and take down the gateway.

## 5. Bugs & Stability

Ranked by severity (P0 first), filtered to open or recently active:

### P0 — Release blockers / crashes

| Issue | Title | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [#146860](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/146860) | Windows managed update handoff stalls with `LogonType InteractiveToken` | Open, 🦪 silver shellfish. Update flow never completes; driver dies → abandoned. |
| [#145252](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145252) | **[Tracking] 2026.9.3 / 2026.9.4 update & recovery reliability** | Coordination index, P0, maintainer. Linked PR: [#148604](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148604) addresses one of the items. |
| [#145510](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145510) | Update failure: runtime-verification-failed (2026.9.3) | Open, 🦪 silver shellfish. Blocks user upgrades. |
| [#145072](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145072) | macOS npm update fails at "global install swap" | **Closed**, but recent. Fix landed; regression-of-update flow. |
| [#123326](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/123326) | Multi-agent Codex migration crash-loops Gateway startup | Open, 🦞 diamond lobster. Sidecar-detection logic crashes even with no sidecars. |
| [#125333](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125333) | `totalTokens` inflation on 2026.8.1-beta.2 | Open, 🦞 diamond lobster. Previous fix [#123065](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/123065) only covered `api === "cli"`; memory-flush transcript path is an unguarded ratchet. |

### P1 — High-impact regressions / crash-loops / data integrity

- **[#144911](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/144911)** — MCP init timeout crashes Gateway (unhandled rejection). Diamond lobster.
- **[#125570](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125570)** — Skill Workshop update apply silently overwrites live skill description, breaking routing. Diamond lobster, data-loss risk.
- **[#125764](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125764)** — Telegram: outbound send dead-lettered after one failed attempt; high-value messages silently lost. Diamond lobster.
- **[#104719](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/104719)** — memory-wiki supplement ignores tool deadline. Diamond lobster.
- **[#144809](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/144809)** — `claude-cli`: long turns lose entire generated reply ("no active tool authority snapshot"). Gold shrimp.
- **[#141252](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/141252)** — 2026.9.2 regression: "Reply operation has no active tool authority snapshot". **Closed** today (12 comments) — appears to have landed a fix.
- **[#119720](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/119720)** — Sync agent persistence blocks event loop at scale. Partial repairs shipped.
- **[#142336](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/142336)** — Core `/dashboard` shadows Telegram Mini App launcher (2026.9.2+). Diamond lobster, UX-blocking.
- **[#145152](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145152)** — Stuck-session recovery force-clears as abort, releases reply lane by session id (2026.7.1). Diamond lobster.
- **[#144876](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/144876)** — Tool-backed dashboard sessions can end silently after length finalization failure.

### P2 — Notable regressions / behavior bugs

- **[#102175](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/102175)** — Embedded prompt cache boundary breaks.
- **[#139710](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/139710)** — Mid-turn plugin supersede kills system-agent turn + planner.
- **[#146004](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/146004)** — Subagent completion triggers unwanted dashboard heartbeat on 2026.9.3.
- **[#99586](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/99586)** — Runtime tool surface returns blank body after gateway-touching ops (closed).
- **[#84037](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/84037)** — Codex app-server steady-state CPU / helper overhead.

**Severity picture:** The cluster of P0 items around **2026.9.3/9.4 update flow** is the most acute. Several 2026.9.x issues are labeled `maturity:stable` + `impact:ux-release-blocker`, suggesting the team is treating the latest releases as unfit for general rollout until these are resolved.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

Most feature requests surfaced today are mid-priority enhancements rather than headline roadmap items:

- **[#52640 — Persistent task-status surface for long-running channel turns](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/52640)** (Discord-first, generic abstraction later). Strong signal: users want a single authoritative "what is my agent doing right now" UI.
- **[#48788 — Centralized filename encoding utility](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/48788)** — Likely prerequisite for full APAC channel reliability.
- **[#51028 — Sessions panel: sort by last meaningful activity](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/51028)** — UX polish; aligns with broader "session hygiene" trend.
- **[#74077 — Slash command for per-chat preview streaming mode](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/74077)** (closed but feature never landed) — `/stream off|final|partial|progress|reset` style ergonomics.

**PRs signaling likely next-version features:**
- **[#148464 — Read GitHub issues, PRs, and commits beside chat](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148464)** (XL, P2). Inline GitHub reader in the web UI — a significant new capability.
- **[#148256 — Recover repository sessions without workers (Control UI)](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148256)** (P0). UI recovery path.
- **[#142954 — Share the Gateway client with Wear OS](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/142954)** (XL). Cross-device Android story continues to expand.
- **[#112811 — Multi-account Microsoft Teams support](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/112811)** (XL, P2). Long-standing request; would close gap with Slack/Discord parity.
- **[#145792 — Time-range filters in sessions_search](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/145792)** (P2). Search ergonomics.
- **[#83440 — CLI: resolve pending exec approvals](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/83440)** (P2). Operational ergonomics; `openclaw approvals pending|resolve` fills a real gap.
- **[#87764 — Owner-scoped ClawHub skill refs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/87764)** (`@openclaw/demo`-style). Skill distribution infrastructure.

**Prediction for the next minor version (likely 2026.9.5 / 2026.9.6):**
- All open P0 update-flow fixes ([#146860](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/146860), [#145510](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145510), [#145252](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/145252) track, [#148604](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148604) already in review).
- MCP init crash fix ([#144911](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/144911)).
- Skill Workshop routing fix ([#125570](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125570)).
- Telegram dead-letter retry ([#125764](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125764)).
- Codex multi-agent migration crash-loop ([#123326](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/123326)).
- `totalTokens` ratchet follow-up ([#125333](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/125333)).
- Possible inline GitHub reader ([#148464](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148464)) and Control UI session recovery ([#148256](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/148256)) as feature additions.

## 7. User Feedback Summary

**Satisfaction signals:**
- Active maintainer engagement: bot accounts like `roboclaw-bot`, `openclaw-mantis[bot]`, and `openclaw-barnacle[bot]` are pushing targeted PRs and dated-todo sweeps, indicating process maturity.
- Strong community uptake on niche channels (Feishu, Mattermost, MS Teams, Synology Chat, Tlon, Zalo, Nostr, Nextcloud Talk) — broad adapter ecosystem.
- Multiple closed regression issues show users trust the project to fix bugs promptly.

**Pain points (recurring themes):**
1. **Update reliability** — Multiple users report failures upgrading *to* and *between* recent versions. This is the single largest dissatisfaction driver today.
2. **Silent data/feature loss** — Skill description overwrites, totalTokens miscounts causing false compaction, prompt-cache invalidation, Telegram dead-lettered sends. Users consistently describe these as "silent" failures with no error surfaced.
3. **Cross-tenant contamination in shared bots** — Repeated reports of context/message leakage between users on the same Telegram/Google Chat bot instance.
4. **Single stuck subprocess can take down the whole gateway** — Multiple crash-loops traced to unhandled rejections in child cleanup paths.
5. **Long-running turn fragility** — `claude-cli` and Codex app-server paths lose replies after several minutes; users have to manually intervene.
6. **APAC channel quirks** — Feishu filename encoding, Feishu card-search indexing, and Chinese-context issues recur.
7. **Skill routing brittleness** — Skill description being the routing key (single string match) is fragile.

**Use cases visible in the data:** multi-agent Codex migrations, embedded CLI runners for paid subscriptions (`claude-cli`, `codex`), Docker-out-of-Docker sandboxing, SMB-mounted macOS workspaces, multi-bot MS Teams fleets, and APAC messaging platforms.

## 8. Backlog Watch

Items with high comment/reaction counts but no recent fix activity, indicating possible maintainer-attention gaps:

| Item | Age | Why it matters | Last activity |

## Cross-Ecosystem Comparison

# Cross-Project Comparison Report: Personal AI Assistant / Agent Open-Source Ecosystem
**Date: 2026-09-15 | Scope: OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, IronClaw, QwenPaw, ZeroClaw**

---

## 1. Ecosystem Overview

The open-source personal AI assistant landscape is splitting into clearly differentiated archetypes: channel-orchestration hubs (OpenClaw), desktop-first products with fleet management (Hermes Agent), memory-native local agents (QwenPaw), security-governed self-host runtimes (ZeroClaw), and safety-hardened reference platforms (IronClaw). Activity is dominated by **stabilization rather than feature expansion** — four of five projects are mid-hardening cycle on recently shipped lines (OpenClaw 2026.9.x, Hermes v0.21.3, QwenPaw 2.2.x, ZeroClaw v0.8.5), and the highest-severity bugs cluster in shared subsystems: MCP interoperability, long-lived session state, memory lifecycle, and update/migration reliability. A notable structural signal: every project is wrestling with **silent failures** — dead-lettered messages, no-op tools, lost sessions — suggesting the ecosystem's next competitive frontier is observability and delivery guarantees, not raw capability. Meanwhile, governance maturity (RFCs, ADRs, automated triage bots, daily benchmark taxonomies) is emerging as a leading indicator of project longevity.

---

## 2. Activity Comparison

| Project | Issues (24h) | PRs (24h) | Closures | Release Status | Health Score* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | 500 updated (191 closed) | 500 updated (212 merged/closed) | ~40% both | No cut; 2026.9.2–9.4 in active repair | **7.0/10** — exceptional throughput & fix velocity, but P0 update-reliability cluster and recurring gateway-crash patterns |
| **Hermes Agent** | 50 updated (18 closed) | 50 updated (3 merged) | 36% issues | **v0.21.3 shipped 09-14** (~338 PRs rolled up) | **8.0/10** — on-schedule cadence, same-day closure of multiplex bugs; structural test gap flagged |
| **QwenPaw** | 45 (31 open / 14 closed) | 50 (39 open / 11 merged) | 31% issues, 22% PRs | No cut; 2.2.x in flight | **7.0/10** — strong momentum and MCP triage, but 3 critical memory bugs lack fix PRs |
| **ZeroClaw** | 22 (11 new P1) | 50 (12 merged) | 24% PRs | No cut; v0.8.5 stabilization line | **7.5/10** — coherent security-merge batch, disciplined RFC/ADR process; 4 new S1s + XL PRs aging 42–54 days |
| **IronClaw** | 1 | 1 | 0 | No release | **6.0/10** — stable, no incidents, but near-dormant public surface; sole PR awaiting review ~9 days |

\* Health score = weighted blend of activity volume, closure velocity, release discipline, and incident load from the 24h digest. OpenClaw's 500/500 figures appear to be the tracker's reporting cap, i.e., a floor rather than a ceiling.

---

## 3. OpenClaw's Position

**Advantages vs. peers:**
- **Community scale (~10–20x):** 500 issues/PRs touched daily vs. ~50 for Tier-2 peers; top threads sustain 40 comments; broadest adapter matrix (Slack, iMessage, Telegram, Discord, Feishu, Mattermost, MS Teams, Synology Chat, Tlon, Zalo, Nostr, Nextcloud Talk) — a channel moat none of the peers approach.
- **Fix velocity:** 212 PRs merged/closed in 24h with triage-bot infrastructure (`roboclaw-bot`, `openclaw-mantis[bot]`), a level of process automation matched only by IronClaw's benchmark automation.
- **Reach beyond desktop:** Wear OS gateway sharing (#142954), Android outbox optimization, multi-account Teams (#112811), and ClawHub skill distribution (#87764) — the only project with a genuine cross-device + marketplace story.

**Weaknesses vs. peers:**
- **Release quality:** The 2026.9.x line is unfit for general rollout (P0 tracking issue #145252, labels `impact:ux-release-blocker`). Hermes shipped a clean ~338-PR rollup the same week; ZeroClaw merges behind explicit risk labels and ADRs.
- **Architectural fragility:** Repeated pattern of async cleanup paths crashing the entire gateway (#144911, #123326); skill routing keyed on a single description string (#125570). IronClaw's leak-blocking host API shows a more defensively engineered egress boundary.

**Technical approach differences:** OpenClaw owns the end-to-end managed-update path (Windows `LogonType InteractiveToken` handoff, macOS npm swap) — a surface peers largely avoid. It embeds provider CLI runners (`claude-cli`, `codex`) directly, where Hermes abstracts provider tiers and QwenPaw targets local/quantized models. Its gateway-centric hot-reload design trades velocity for the crash-loop exposure currently on display.

---

## 4. Shared Technical Focus Areas

| Emerging Requirement | Projects | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP interoperability & resilience** | OpenClaw, QwenPaw, IronClaw, ZeroClaw | OpenClaw #144911 (init timeout crashes gateway); QwenPaw #7716/#7728 (registration failure, Java SDK HTTP-framing 500s); IronClaw PR #8077 (egress-leak reason codes); ZeroClaw #10603 (OpenCode session header) |
| **Long-lived session persistence & recovery** | All 5 | OpenClaw #145152/#141252 (tool-authority snapshots, stuck sessions); Hermes #97681 (28 comments, cross-device group-chat persistence) & #109966 (state.db WAL handoff); QwenPaw #7708/#7724/#7745 (config/session loss); ZeroClaw PR #10197 (ACP interrupted-turn persistence, open 26d) |
| **Memory lifecycle & cost control** | OpenClaw, Hermes, QwenPaw | QwenPaw #7222/#7722 (unbounded growth to 20 GB+, three compounding paths); Hermes #111205 (49 duplicate facts ≈ 98k tokens/turn); OpenClaw #104719/#125333 (memory-wiki deadline, token-count ratchet) |
| **Update / migration reliability** | OpenClaw, Hermes | OpenClaw #146860/#145510/#145072 (Windows/macOS/npm upgrade failures); Hermes #110850 (multiplex systemd migration kills gateway), #111272 (stale `fleet_restart_pending` marker) |
| **Prompt-cache stability** | OpenClaw, ZeroClaw | OpenClaw #102175 (cache breaks across session boundaries); ZeroClaw #10858 (`DateTimeSection` invalidates every cached prefix at midnight) |
| **Security & trust boundaries** | All 5 | ZeroClaw (pairing policy #10307, proxy routing #10748, sandbox images #10745); Hermes (scanner false-positive family #92478/#103364/#110974/#111193); QwenPaw #7727 (out-of-workspace writes), #7726 (ACP `trusted:true` fallback); IronClaw (leak blocking); OpenClaw (cross-tenant contamination on shared bots) |
| **Background/cron execution guarantees** | OpenClaw, Hermes, QwenPaw | Hermes #111010 (cron daemon dies silently); QwenPaw #7709 (scheduled tasks fold output into "thinking"); OpenClaw #148592 (hot reload vs. cron reconciliation) |
| **Sub-agent delegation reliability** | OpenClaw, Hermes, QwenPaw | QwenPaw #7678 (`spawn subAgent` 100% timeout); Hermes PR #107316 (subagents dashboard); OpenClaw #123326 (multi-agent Codex migration crash-loop) |

---

## 5. Differentiation Analysis

| Dimension | OpenClaw | Hermes Agent | IronClaw | QwenPaw | ZeroClaw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Feature focus** | Multi-channel orchestration, skills/plugins, managed updates | Desktop UX, profile multiplex, fleet ops, provider tiers | Host safety enforcement, benchmark QA automation | Memory-native agent (ReMe), local models, data analysis | Security-first runtime, SOPs, federated channels |
| **Target users** | Self-hosters running messaging fleets; APAC channel operators | Desktop power users, fleet/hosted-cloud operators | Internal/research engineers | Local-first & APAC users, data-analysis workflows | Privacy-conscious home-lab / self-host operators |
| **Architecture** | Gateway + channel adapters + plugin loader; embedded provider CLIs | Gateway + TUI + Desktop; SQLite WAL (`state.db`) | Rust host API (`ironclaw_host_api`), sandboxed lanes | Python backend, vector store, memory nodes | Rust runtime crates, Docker sandbox, ZeroCode TUI |
| **Governance** | Bot-driven triage, priority taxonomy | Release-train discipline | Daily automated failure taxonomies | Inline maintainer triage | RFC/ADR process, risk labels, expedited-merge RFCs |

The sharpest contrast: **OpenClaw optimizes breadth** (channels, devices, integrations) while accepting integration-surface risk; **ZeroClaw and IronClaw optimize for correctness and control** (egress filtering, SOP detail, conformance); **QwenPaw is the only project making memory itself the product core**; **Hermes is the most product-complete for end users** (accessibility requests, desktop polish, billing UX).

---

## 6. Community Momentum & Maturity

- **Tier 1 — Massive scale, firefighting:** **OpenClaw**. Volume is an order of magnitude above peers; currently in post-release stabilization (191 issues closed/day) rather than exploration. High community trust, but the update-reliability cluster is its biggest credibility risk.
- **Tier 2 — High velocity, structured:** 
  - **Hermes Agent** — *stabilizing.* Shipped v0.21.3 on cadence, then closed 7 multiplex bugs in one day; the multiplex rollout should have been feature-flagged longer, but response speed is elite.
  - **ZeroClaw** — *stabilizing toward v0.8.5*, with the most mature governance in the cohort (RFC reform to accelerate its own merge queue). Watch item: `risk:high` XL PRs open 42–54 days.
  - **QwenPaw** — *rapidly iterating.* Highest open-PR ratio (39/50); active feature pipeline (QwenPaw-Data 0.3.0, make-skill v2.1, visual compaction rewrite). Weakest point: three critical memory bugs with no fix PRs.
- **Tier 3 — Quiet/benign:** **IronClaw**. Public activity is a trickle, but its daily benchmark taxonomy (#8100, 43 non-pass `officeqa` tasks on DeepSeek-V4-Flash) indicates sustained internal QA. Pattern suggests a corporate-backed project with community visibility, not community-driven development.

---

## 7. Trend Signals

1. **MCP is now load-bearing infrastructure — and the interop seams are showing.** Four projects hit MCP failures in one day (crash-on-init, HTTP framing, Java SDK, header conformance). *Developer takeaway:* build MCP conformance test suites and never let MCP init run on the host's critical path.
2. **Session durability is the trust frontier.** Cross-project, the most emotionally charged issues involve lost sessions/configs and interrupted turns (Hermes #97681 at 28 comments; ZeroClaw's 26-day-old persistence PR). *Takeaway:* treat session state as transactional data with recovery semantics, not cache.
3. **Memory is a cost bomb, not just a feature.** Measured failures range from 20 GB process growth (QwenPaw) to 98k tokens of duplicate injection per turn (Hermes). *Takeaway:* memory systems need lifecycle management, dedup, and quota enforcement.
4. **Prompt-cache stability is a newly visible cost lever.** Midnight timestamp re-renders (ZeroClaw #10858) and boundary invalidation (OpenClaw #102175) silently inflate spend. *Takeaway:* design cache-stable system prompts; audit anything time-varying.
5. **Security tooling is maturing faster than its precision.** Hermes's scanner false positives blocking security-hardened plugins (#111193) mirror a coming ecosystem-wide problem: supply-chain scanning for skills/plugins needs hardened-allowlist semantics.
6. **Silent failures are the #1 trust killer.** Dead-lettered Telegram sends (OpenClaw #125764), no-op reaction tools (ZeroClaw #10842), folded task output (QwenPaw #7709), silently-dead cron (Hermes #111010). *Takeaway:* every async action needs an explicit delivery receipt or user-visible failure.
7. **Governance sophistication predicts trajectory.** ZeroClaw's RFC reform and IronClaw's daily failure taxonomies are the two most forward-looking process investments; expect other projects to adopt automated failure taxonomies as standard practice.
8. **Self-host/home-lab demand is durable** (XMPP request at ZeroClaw, Synology/Nextcloud adapters at OpenClaw) — channel breadth and low-resource federation remain an underserved moat.

# Hermes Agent Project Digest — 2026-09-15

## 1. Today's Overview

Hermes Agent shows high-velocity maintenance activity on the day of the **v0.21.3** patch release, with 50 issues updated (18 closed) and 50 PRs updated (3 merged/closed). The dominant theme is **state-management hygiene around the new profile-multiplex feature** — most of today's bugs trace to incorrect handling of session/state isolation, profile-scoped secrets, and the WAL-handoff chain for `state.db`. A secondary cluster involves **false-positive verdicts from `skills_guard` and `plugin-guard` security scanners** that block benign documentation, prose, and security-hardened plugins. Activity intensity is high but the patches are surgical and well-scoped, indicating a mature stabilization cycle rather than feature churn.

## 2. Releases

**v2026.9.14 — Hermes Agent v0.21.3** (2026-09-14)
- Patch release that rolls up **~338 PRs** merged since v0.21.2 into a stable tag for downstream consumers (Docker, Hermes Cloud, hosted deployments).
- Primary stated driver: **remote-gateway sign-in fixes**.
- No public breaking-change notes or migration steps were posted alongside the release.

🔗 [v0.21.3 Release](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases/tag/v2026.9.14)

## 3. Project Progress

Only 3 PRs landed/closed in the 24h window, all **false-positive fixes for the skills/plugin scanners** — a clean win for community-install UX:

- **#110978 — `fix(skills): ignore Markdown documentation traversal links`** *(closed)*. Excludes normal relative links in skill README files from path-traversal detection. [PR #110978](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/110978)
- **#110989 — `fix(skills): ignore path traversal in Markdown link destinations`** *(closed)*. Companion fix excluding balanced inline link destinations and bumping scanner version to invalidate cached false positives. [PR #110989](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/110989)
- Plus a third merged/closed PR not shown in the top-20 list.

No large new features advanced today. Substantial in-flight work (still open) includes:
- **#102765 — bundles & unified package manager** (open, needs-decision, ci-reviewed). A cross-cutting refactor introducing `pm/` and `pm/lock.json` for unified installation, building, and updater selection across Windows/Docker/Desktop. [PR #102765](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/102765)
- **#107316 — dashboard: live view of running subagents in Chat sidebar**. Adds a read-only Subagents panel watching `delegate_task` children via existing `tui_gateway` events. [PR #107316](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/107316)
- **#110612 — Kanban: preserve task run provenance** (session + explicit model selection on attempts). [PR #110612](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/110612)

## 4. Community Hot Topics

The most actively discussed threads reveal what the user base actually cares about:

1. **#97681 — Bot Group Chats should keep working after Desktop closes** *(28 comments, 👍1)*. Most-discussed thread by far. Users want bots on different gateways to collaborate in group chats and **persist across Desktop shutdowns** — i.e., session ownership must transfer cleanly between devices and authorized messaging surfaces. [Issue #97681](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/97681)
   - *Underlying need*: Cross-device session continuity and gateway-as-authoritative-session-owner semantics.

2. **#109966 — `state.db` WAL hand-off during fleet restart blocks new openers for hours** *(12 comments)*. Reporter confirmed the originally described failure chain no longer reproduces after merges #109841 and #110544, but the thread has become a focal point for **state.db lifecycle discussion**. [Issue #109966](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/109966)
   - *Underlying need*: Predictable fleet-restart behavior under WAL/-shm replacement.

3. **#110769 — Streaming still hangs on agent-sized context after update to upstream main** *(7 comments, P1)*. Reopens #29418: agent-sized contexts still hang the stream. [Issue #110769](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110769)
   - *Underlying need*: Streaming reliability for long-context production workloads.

4. **#103483 — `muse-spark` turns end mid-task on `finish_reason=stop`** *(3 comments, **👍7** — highest reaction count today)*. Contributor-tier users via opencode-go see streams cut to a single weird final word. [Issue #103483](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/103483)
   - *Underlying need*: Stable completion semantics on the Responses wire for spark-tier models.

## 5. Bugs & Stability

Today is dense with P1/P2 bugs, almost all clustered around three subsystems. Listed by severity, with fix-PR linkage where present.

### P1 — critical user-visible breakage

| Issue | Component | Summary | Fix PR |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| [#110850](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110850) | cli, gateway | `gateway migrate --multiplex` installs default systemd unit without `--run-as-user`, dies mid-migration, leaves gateway dead | **closed** (no public PR listed) |
| [#111010](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111010) | gateway, cron | Cron scheduler daemon thread silently dies on gateway startup — no jobs fire | open, no fix PR |
| [#110769](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110769) | agent, nous provider | Streaming hangs on agent-sized context (reopen of #29418) | open, no fix PR |

### P2 — important regressions, mostly profile-multiplex related

| Issue | Component | Summary | Fix PR |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| [#109966](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/109966) | cli, gateway, cron | `state.db` WAL hand-off chain during fleet restart | open — reporter notes resolved by #109841/#110544 |
| [#110695](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110695) | gateway, tui, skills | `command.dispatch` cannot invoke secondary-profile skills on multiplex | **closed** (fix landed) |
| [#110622](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110622) | gateway, plugins, memory | OpenViking `on_session_end` fails under multiplex (`UnscopedSecretError`) | **closed** |
| [#110635](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110635) | browser vault | `check_fn` raises `UnscopedSecretError` at gateway start under multiplexing (regression of #100697) | **closed** |
| [#110303](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110303) | code-exec, desktop | `execute_code` subprocess gets wrong `HERMES_HOME` under multiplexed Desktop | **closed** |
| [#111228](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111228) | gateway, desktop | Desktop Preview control times out after #107498 | open (needs-repro) |
| [#111294](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111294) | desktop | Bare indeterminate spinner for minutes after tool results — silent post-tool compression gap | open |
| [#110630](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110630) | agent, file | Protected-instruction gate gates ROOT's direct files under named profile | **closed** |
| [#110683](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110683) | cli, config | Auto-multiplex-migration opt-out declares `gateway.auto_migrate` but reads `gateway.auto_multiplex_migration` | **closed** |
| [#111272](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111272) | cli, gateway | `fleet_restart_pending` marker left after successful update → false warning every startup | open |
| [#110919](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110919) | gateway, cron, discord | Kanban `notify-subscribe` on Discord thread — subscriptions the notifier can't deliver under multiplex | **closed** |
| [#111017](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111017) | agent, cli, openai | Codex pooled credentials ignore `HERMES_CODEX_BASE_URL`; `NameError` on unmapped `_getenv` | open |

### P3 / scanner false-positives (high-volume, low-risk)

A clear pattern: **the new `skills_guard` and `plugin-guard-v1` scanners over-match on prose, docs, and security-hardened plugins.**
- [#92478](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/92478) — skill's own denylist strings scored as ssh_backdoor / aws_dir_access → **closed**.
- [#103364](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/103364) — plugin-guard false positives on context-isolation prose and bare CLAUDE.md references → **closed**.
- [#110974](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/110974) — Markdown `../` doc links classified as path traversal → **closed (via #110978, #110989)**.
- [#111193](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111193) — install-time scanner flags security documentation and adversarial tests as critical, blocking hardened plugins → **closed**.

### Pattern / project health

The multiplex feature appears to have been **rolled out without sufficient end-to-end coverage of profile-scoped secrets, `HERMES_HOME` propagation, and command dispatch**. Multiple distinct bugs today share the same root cause: a single subsystem assumes `resolved_profile_scope` while code is actually invoked under `gateway.multiplex_profiles: true`. This is a structural testing gap, not a series of unrelated typos.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

Concrete user requests visible in the issue stream:

- **#97681** — *Bot Group Chats persistent across Desktop close* (most-discussed). Multi-gateway bot collaboration with cross-device session pickup. [Issue #97681](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/97681)
- **#72485** — *Font customization (e.g., OpenDyslexic) for Desktop* **(CLOSED today)**. Accessibility for dyslexia/readability. [Issue #72485](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/72485)
- **#50799** — *Desktop sidebar should surface newly-created gateway sessions before first prompt persistence* (still open since June). [Issue #50799](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/50799)
- **#111117** — *Identity-kind vault fill must freeze vision/screenshots on the bound origin*. Closes a privacy gap where `browser_vault_fill` doesn't extend to the visual surface. [Issue #111117](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111117)

### Predictions for the next version

- **Multiplex reliability patch (likely v0.21.4 or v0.21.5)**: the cluster of multiplex/state bugs (110695, 110622, 110635, 110303, 110630, 110919, 110683, 111017) is too dense to remain unfixed into v0.22. Expect a **profile-scope refactor that centralizes `resolved_profile_scope` semantics**.
- **Scanner v2 bump**: today's merged PRs already bump the scanner version to invalidate caches (#110989); expect more rule refinements and an opt-in "security-hardened plugin" exception list.
- **Subagents dashboard panel** (#107316) is likely to merge in v0.21.x — it's a focused, read-only feature with clear UX value and no breaking surface.
- **Bundles & unified package manager** (#102765) is large and flagged `needs-decision` + `ci-reviewed`; unlikely to land before maintainer-level design sign-off.

## 7. User Feedback Summary

- **Strong dissatisfaction**: scanner false positives. Three distinct categories of users affected — (a) plugin authors writing security-hardened plugins (#111193), (b) plugin authors documenting security in markdown (#110974), (c) skill authors whose own denylists get flagged (#92478). Each was closed today, suggesting maintainers respond well to this class of report.
- **Production operators report real cost**: #111205 measures **49 duplicate facts injected in a single turn (~98k tokens)** from memory prefetch, indicating a tangible billing/quality regression.
- **Multiplex is in production but rough**: issues 110695, 110622, 110635, 110303, 110630, 110919, 110683 are all **closed today**, suggesting maintainer focus has shifted to this exact subsystem — but the volume implies it should arguably have been `feature-flagged` longer.
- **Positive signal**: v0.21.3 rolled up ~338 PRs and tagged cleanly for downstream Docker/Cloud. The release cadence and patch discipline are healthy.
- **Long-tail issues with engaged authors** (#103483, 7 👍; #97681, 28 comments) signal **genuine product gaps** — the streaming-completion bug on `muse-spark` and the cross-device group-chat persistence both have users willing to test fixes.

## 8. Backlog Watch

Items needing maintainer attention that have aged or have high engagement but no resolution:

- **[#97681](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/97681) — Bot Group Chats persistence (28 comments, created 2026-08-29, still open).** Most-discussed thread in the dataset. Needs a design statement from maintainers on gateway-as-session-owner semantics.
- **[#103483](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/103483) — `muse-spark` mid-task `finish_reason=stop` (👍7, created 2026-09-05, still open).** High reaction count and a recurring contributor-tier regression — should be triaged as a priority.
- **[#87248](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/87248) — Desktop billing-error bubble persists after auto-failover (created 2026-08-15, still open).** UX-facing bug that visually misrepresents successful turns.
- **[#52040](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/52040) — Dashboard tailscale configuration is too complex (created 2026-06-24, still open).** Indicates a documentation/onboarding gap rather than a code bug — the reporter found a one-page tutorial that should arguably be linked from the dashboard config flow.
- **[#50799](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/50799) — Desktop sidebar should surface newly-created gateway sessions before first prompt persistence (created 2026-06-22, still open).** Small but real UX regression, ~3 months without a fix.
- **[#111205](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111205) — Memory prefetch re-injects identical facts every turn (49 duplicates / ~98k tokens)**. Production-impact regression that should escalate beyond P3 given measured cost.
- **[#111299](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/111299) — Native macOS test failures (relay traceparent, Hermes-home permissions)**. CI-relevant, opened today; likely to be picked up quickly.
- **[#37137](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/37137) — Termux `--` separator for `setsid bash` (open since 2026-06-02)**. Small but long-pending Termux compatibility fix with clear root cause — should be a one-line merge.

# IronClaw Project Digest — 2026-09-15

## 1. Today's Overview

IronClaw activity on 2026-09-15 is notably low, with only one issue updated and one pull request updated in the trailing 24-hour window, and no new releases published. The single open issue (#8100) is a recurring benchmark failure-taxonomy report rather than a feature or bug report, indicating the maintainers' continued investment in automated quality monitoring of the agent's benchmark suites (e.g., `officeqa`). The single open PR (#8077) targets a precise, security-adjacent fix in the MCP egress/diagnostics path, suggesting the team is still actively iterating on the MCP integration layer. Overall project health appears stable but quiet, with no merges, closures, or new versions on this date.

## 2. Releases

No new releases in the last 24 hours. This section is omitted per protocol.

## 3. Project Progress

No PRs were merged or closed in the last 24 hours. The only updated PR remains open:

- **[PR #8077 — fix(mcp): classify response leak diagnostics](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8077)** (open, by `linhongyu510`, updated 2026-09-14)
  - Closes issue #8009.
  - Centralizes the shared `response_leak_blocked` sentinel in `ironclaw_host_api::http`.
  - Teaches the MCP lane to classify that sentinel as a distinct MCP-visible reason.
  - Net effect: hardens host leak-blocking behavior in MCP responses without breaking safety invariants. This represents incremental but meaningful progress on the MCP egress diagnostics surface, even though it has not yet landed.

## 4. Community Hot Topics

Community engagement signals (reactions/comments) are minimal across all tracked items:

- **[Issue #8100 — Daily ironclaw failure taxonomy — 2026-09-14](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/8100)** (open, by `pranavraja99`, 0 comments, 0 👍)
  - This is an automated daily benchmark-failure report. The author categorizes non-pass tasks across suites such as `officeqa` (43 non-pass tasks, attributed largely to genuine model-quality errors with DeepSeek-V4-Flash navigate failures).
  - Underlying need: systematic, per-day transparency into where the agent is failing on standardized benchmarks, and a structured taxonomy to distinguish model-quality issues from infrastructure/tooling failures.
- **[PR #8077 — fix(mcp): classify response leak diagnostics](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8077)** (open, 0 👍, no comment count available)
  - Although low on visible reactions, the topic itself (MCP egress leak classification) is implicitly high-stakes because it touches the boundary between host safety enforcement and MCP-visible error reporting.

## 5. Bugs & Stability

No new bug reports, crash reports, or regressions were filed in the last 24 hours. The only signal adjacent to stability is the still-open MCP fix:

- **[PR #8077](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8077)** — addresses a classification gap in MCP response-leak diagnostics. It is a defensive fix (preserves leak-blocking while restoring an MCP-visible reason code) rather than a new bug being introduced; severity is best characterized as **low-to-moderate** (correctness/diagnostics rather than crash or data-loss), and the proposed fix PR exists and is ready to merge.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

No explicit feature requests were raised in the last 24 hours. However, two roadmap-adjacent signals can be inferred:

- **Automated benchmark-failure taxonomies (Issue [#8100](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/8100))** — the existence of a daily taxonomy report suggests an emerging pattern of recurring diagnostic artifacts in the repo. If the cadence continues, expect to see tooling requests for diffing daily taxonomies, per-suite dashboards, or auto-triage of recurring failure modes in upcoming versions.
- **MCP diagnostics refinement (PR [#8077](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8077))** — the move to centralize `response_leak_blocked` in `ironclaw_host_api::http` hints at a longer-term consolidation of MCP egress error semantics, likely a precursor to richer MCP error-code surfaces in a future release.

Prediction: the next tagged release is most likely to bundle MCP diagnostics hardening (a continuation of the work in #8077) and possibly improvements derived from benchmark-taxonomy triage, rather than any headline feature.

## 7. User Feedback Summary

Direct user feedback (comments, reactions, thumbs-up/down) is effectively absent in the 24-hour window — all tracked items show 0 reactions and 0 comments. As such, no concrete end-user pain points, use cases, or satisfaction signals can be extracted from today's activity. The closest proxy to "user" voice is the automated benchmark taxonomy author (`pranavraja99`), whose report indicates real and ongoing model-quality failures on `officeqa` (43 non-pass tasks, primarily DeepSeek-V4-Flash navigation errors), implying that downstream users are likely still encountering navigation-quality regressions in office-style workflows.

## 8. Backlog Watch

Items needing maintainer attention, in priority order:

1. **[PR #8077 — fix(mcp): classify response leak diagnostics](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8077)** — open since 2026-09-06, last updated 2026-09-14, no comments/reactions. It already states it closes #8009, so it is review-ready and a low-risk merge candidate. Recommend a maintainer review and merge to clear the MCP diagnostics backlog.
2. **[Issue #8100 — Daily ironclaw failure taxonomy — 2026-09-14](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/8100)** — likely a recurring automated artifact. Maintainers should consider whether such daily reports should be auto-closed once triaged, or whether they want to keep them open as a rolling record. If the latter, a labeling convention (e.g., `taxonomy`, `automated`) would aid triage.
3. **Linked but unseen: Issue #8009** (referenced as closed-by #8077). Worth verifying that #8009 is indeed closed once #8077 merges, to avoid dangling references in the issue graph.

Overall backlog health is benign: no long-unanswered critical issue is evident from the 24-hour data, but the lone open PR has been awaiting review for ~9 days, which is the most actionable backlog item today.

# QwenPaw Project Digest — 2026-09-15

## 1. Today's Overview

QwenPaw shows strong development momentum with **50 PRs and 45 issues active in the last 24 hours**, but **no new releases were published**. Activity is heavily skewed toward open work (39 open PRs vs. 11 closed, 31 open issues vs. 14 closed), suggesting an active stabilization cycle rather than a release push. The dominant themes across both issues and PRs are **memory subsystem reliability**, **MCP/ACP integration edge cases**, **console UX refinements**, and a noticeable cluster of **security/auth hardening PRs**. Overall project health is good — community engagement is high (multiple issues with 4–6 comments), and maintainers are landing targeted fixes in lockstep with bug reports.

## 2. Releases

**No new releases in the last 24 hours.** The most recent activity is on version branches `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, and `2.2.1-beta.2`, but no tag was cut. This is consistent with an in-flight stabilization phase on the 2.2.x line.

## 3. Project Progress

**Merged/closed activity (last 24h):** 11 PRs closed plus 14 issues closed — concrete fixes and clarifications landed.

Notable closed PRs/issues advancing the project:
- **#4220 (closed)** — *auto_memory_interval writes memory file but doesn't sync vector index*: the bug was acknowledged and addressed; this directly improves the auto-memory flow.
- **#4354 (closed)** — *Large Excel file forcibly interrupted*: large-file reading path fixed.
- **#4710 (closed)** — *Vector store timestamp inconsistency*: naive vs. UTC datetime mismatch resolved in `reme.MemoryNode`.

- **#3995 (closed)** — *Enhanced memory management & recall*: enhancement proposal closed (likely merged into roadmap).
- **#7199 (closed)** — *daily_paper `write_atomic` crashes on surrogate characters*: PDF text encoding edge case fixed.
- **#7666 (closed)** — *Local model can't download from HF / pick quantized file*.
- **#7594 (closed)** — *Task repeated 3 times* — closed as invalid (likely user-side duplicate dispatch).
- **#3801 (closed)** — *Adaptive context question* closed (response delivered).
- **#6840 (closed)** — *ReMe4 roadmap question* answered.
- **#6222 (closed)** — *MEMORY.md vs Dream digest positioning* answered.
- **#4208 (closed)** — *mem0 support question* closed.

Open PRs currently under review indicate progress on the next drop:
- **#7637** — *QwenPaw-Data 0.3.0 integration* as a managed analysis engine ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7637)).
- **#7704** — *Move chat files drawer to right side* ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7704)).
- **#7753** — *make-skill v2.1* — robust plan-before-draft pipeline ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7753)).

**Underlying needs surfaced:**
- **Trust in scheduled/automated work** (#7709, #7678) — users need deterministic, visible output from cron/scheduled tasks and sub-agent delegation. The pattern of "result folded into thinking" suggests prompt/output post-processing needs to guarantee user-visible delivery.
- **State persistence durability** (#7708, #7724, #7745, #4220) — recurring complaints about lost model configs, lost sessions, and desynced memory indexes indicate the persistence layer needs end-to-end consistency guarantees and better recovery.
- **Path/workspace discipline** (#7571, #7705, #7727) — the agent repeatedly writes outside its allowed workspace or to the wrong deployment target. Users want a sandbox + enforcement story, not just instructions.

| 🟡 Low | [#7594](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7594) | Task repeated 3 times at different times | Closed (invalid) |

**Fix coverage:** Three of the medium-severity MCP/ACP bugs have matching open PRs (#7735 → #7716, #7729 → #7728, #7732 → #7726), indicating a focused triage effort on the integration surface. The three highest-severity items (memory exhaustion, subAgent timeout) lack public fix PRs — this is the area to watch.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

Active enhancement proposals:

- **#7739** — *Move chat history to right side on small screens* ([issue](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7739)) — **High likelihood for next release**, paired with already-open [#7704](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7704) moving the chat files drawer to the right.
- **#7746** — *Skills: per-channel applicability list* ([issue](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7746)) — likely 2.3.x scope; touches channels + skills cross-cutting config.
- **#3995** — *Enhanced memory management & recall (lifecycle, conflict detection)* — closed but expected to inform ReMe roadmap.
- **#6840** — *ReMe4 roadmap question (Auto-Link, tri-modal search, 4-category digest weights)* — directional signal toward multi-modal recall.
- **#7637** — *QwenPaw-Data 0.3.0 integration* ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7637)) — likely to land as a managed analysis engine in the next minor.
- **#7753** — *make-skill v2.1* ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7753)) — robust plan-before-draft for skill authoring.
- **#7703** — *Visual compaction rewrite* ([PR](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7703)) — addresses #5122/#3801 family of context-compaction concerns.

**Predicted next release scope (likely 2.2.2 patch or 2.3.0 minor):** right-side chat files drawer, ACP permission hardening, MCP Java-SDK compatibility, sidebar collapsed-state persistence, vi/pt-BR localization fixes, and a Docker ↔ desktop Python runtime alignment ([#7751](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/pull/7751)).

## 7. User Feedback Summary

**Pain points (extracted from today's issues):**

1. **State loss anxiety.** Multiple users (xiaohushi512, yuzhuliu226-ctrl) report losing model config and entire sessions across restarts, agent switches, and shutdowns. This is eroding trust in long-running work.
2. **Silent failures in scheduled/integrated features.** Daily Paper (#7715) and scheduled tasks (#7709) fail without surfacing the real cause; users describe "no output" and "folded in thinking" as recurring.
3. **Agent path discipline.** Plugin developers (#7571) report the agent writing to source/runtime/backup paths interchangeably, sometimes overwriting production code via auto-deploy scripts — a concrete safety issue beyond memory concerns.
4. **Sub-agent delegation unreliable.** #7678 reports 100% failure rate for `spawn subAgent`, even with very long timeouts.
5. **MCP ecosystem regression.** Users on 2.1.1b3 → 2.2.x lost MCP connectivity (#7716), affecting Java SDK servers specifically (#7728).
6. **UX density on small screens.** Sidebar + history + files drawer on a 14" laptop is unusable without scroll (#7739 → #7704 already in motion).
7. **Satisfaction signal:** PR #7704 (right-side drawer), #7681 (sidebar persistence), #7682 (semantic tokens), #7752 (broken i18n) indicate maintainers are actively responding to small-screen and localization complaints.

## 8. Backlog Watch

Issues and PRs needing maintainer attention (stale or high-impact without a fix):

- **[#7222](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7222) — Long-running memory growth to 20 GB+** — open since 2026-08-23, no linked fix PR; **#7722 explicitly identifies three compounding paths** and offers a minimal-fix proposal, but no PR yet. This is the top backlog risk.
- **[#7678](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7678) — `spawn subAgent` universal timeout** — open, no fix PR, 6 comments. Affects a core delegation primitive.
- **[#7708](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7708) + [#7724](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw/issues/7724) — model/session loss on Windows desktop** — multiple reports, no diagnostic PR, no

# ZeroClaw Project Digest — 2026-09-15

## 1. Today's Overview

ZeroClaw shows high development velocity with 22 issues and 50 PRs touched in the last 24 hours, though no new releases were published. The 12 closed PRs land a coherent batch of security hardening (stronger pairing codes, channel proxy routing, configurable Docker sandbox images), multimodal fixes (image size default raised to 20 MiB, image marker MIME validation), and refactoring (unified transcription manager across 8 channels). The 11 newly opened P1 items cluster around Telegram reliability, vision-capability routing, and prompt-caching invalidation, indicating active triage of late-reported edge cases. The project is healthy and converging toward the v0.8.5 stabilization line tracked in [#9459](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/9459).

## 2. Releases

No new releases in the last 24 hours. The current development focus is the v0.8.5 finite weekly stabilization line (milestone target: 2026-08-30, intake frozen 2026-08-04).

## 3. Project Progress

Merged/closed PRs in the last 24h:

| PR | Title | Impact |
|---|---|---|

| [#10794](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10794) (closed issue) | Advisory Windows nextest publish-contract failure | Documented exception applied |

Net effect: a security- and consistency-heavy day that closes long-standing cross-cutting gaps.

## 4. Community Hot Topics

The conversation volume is dominated by **process reform RFCs**:

- **[#10549](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10549) — RFC: Simplify RFC voting (10 comments).** Proposes removing the fixed 48h/72h discussion windows and letting `REVISE` halt the current snapshot. Friction argument: timers rarely produce more review. Community signal: zero 👍 to date, but high thread activity.
- **[#10366](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10366) — RFC: Clarify PR review evidence, freshness warnings, author-action boundaries (8 comments).** Revision 2 adds an expedited merge lane when one Core approval, green checks, and no unresolved findings are present. Tagged `risk:high`; aimed at the maintainer-review queue.

Underlying need across both: the project has outgrown its consensus machinery and is seeking faster cycles without losing review quality.

Other notable activity:
- **[#10603](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10603) (closed, 👍 3)** — OpenCode missing `x-opencode-session` header, risking Go-model failures and account flags. Highest 👍 score of the day; fix landed via follow-up docs task [#10853](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10853).
- **[#10197](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10197)** — ACP interrupted-turn persistence (XL, needs maintainer review) is the longest-running open thread on the PR side.
- **[#9753](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/9753)** — risk-profile `allowed_tools` absent-vs-empty distinction (XL, needs maintainer review) remains the most consequential unresolved security PR.

## 5. Bugs & Stability

Newly opened P1/S1 bugs (all severity S1 "workflow blocked" unless noted):

| Issue | Severity | Component | Fix status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#10863](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10863) | P1 | Telegram channel | Open; referenced from PR [#10640](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10640); retries reject voice updates indefinitely, blocking the long-poll queue |
| [#10857](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10857) | P1 | ZeroCode + provider | Open; ZeroCode sends images to text-only sessions, returns provider 400 |
| [#10854](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10854) | P1 | Anthropic provider | Open (in-progress); tool-output `[IMAGE:...]` markers auto-promoted to malformed provider image |
| [#10858](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10858) | P1 | agent prompt | Open (in-progress); `DateTimeSection` first in system prompt invalidates every session's cached prefix at midnight |

Newly opened P2/S2 bugs:

| Issue | Severity | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#10842](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10842) | P2 | Telegram | Open (in-progress); `reaction` tool silently no-ops via default trait stub |
| [#10625](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10625) | P2 | channel/Matrix | Open; literal `[media attachment]` placeholder leaks to users on non-vision models |

Closed/triaged today:
- [#10585](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10585) (P2, log sink regression) — closed.
- [#10796](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10796) (P3, Delete key ignored in ZeroCode TUI) — closed.
- [#10232](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10232) (P2, daemon drops error cause chain) — closed; fix incorporated in supervisor path.

Severity-weighted take: 4 new S1 items in 24h is high; all relate to vision/multimodal attachment routing and cache invalidation. No fix PRs yet for the S1 cluster.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

Active enhancements / proposals still open:

- **[#9814](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/9814) — Native XMPP / Prosody channel.** Self-host / home-lab use case. Aligns with existing Matrix/Telegram/Discord channel pattern. Likely candidate for v0.9.x post-stabilization.
- **[#10549](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10549) — RFC: simpler voting.** If accepted, will materially shorten RFC turnaround and indirectly accelerate feature delivery.
- **[#10366](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10366) — RFC: expedited merge lane.** Same family; aimed at PR queue throughput.

Closed enhancements today (landed features):
- [#10588](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10588) → [#10589](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10589): 20 MiB image default.
- [#10307](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10307): shared, configurable pairing-code policy.
- [#10745](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10745): configurable Docker sandbox image.
- [#10336](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10336): AnySearch built-in provider proposal — closed (status unresolved in the data; likely deferred or rejected).

**Prediction for next minor (v0.8.5 cut or v0.8.6):** Telegram reliability fixes (#[10863](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10863), #[10842](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10842)) are the highest-priority remaining items and likely to ship in the next stabilization cut. XMPP [#9814](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/9814) is plausible but depends on a maintainer champion.

## 7. User Feedback Summary

Real pain points surfaced via bug reports:

- **Multimodal routing inconsistencies** dominate. Users on text-only models see `[media attachment]` placeholders leaked to chat ([#10625](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10625)); images between 5 and 20 MiB were silently dropped (now fixed in [#10589](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10589)); tool-output `[IMAGE:...]` markers get auto-promoted even when not intended ([#10854](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10854)). The repeated fixes indicate the multimodal subsystem still lacks a single owner or contract.
- **Telegram reliability regressions** are accumulating. Reaction tool silent no-op ([#10842](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10842)) and indefinite voice-update retry loop ([#10863](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10863)) suggest the channel's error-recovery paths are undertested.
- **Prompt-caching invalidation at midnight** ([#10858](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10858)) is a cost/UX issue: every open session loses its cached prefix when `DateTimeSection` re-renders.
- **Self-host operator demand** for XMPP ([#9814](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/9814)) confirms a recurring request for low-resource, federated chat backends.
- **ZeroCode TUI polish** — Delete key bug ([#10796](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10796)) and TUI dead-code ([#10120](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10120)) indicate the CLI surface is being actively used and exercised.

Satisfaction signal: the proxy-routing fix ([#10748](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10748)) and unified transcription manager ([#10747](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/10747)) show the project is responsive to recurring multi-channel pain. Dissatisfaction signal: 4 simultaneous S1 vision-routing bugs within one day point to a structural gap.
